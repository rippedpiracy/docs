## Wait, what is a PreDB?

As listed in the [**Scene Glossary**](https://ripped.guide/Scene/scene-glossary/),

> A database with all release titles. These release titles are not for download, they are just records.

> Apart from the release title, a record often also contains the release size, release date, and sometimes also NFOs.

> With commands one is able to 'check' a release.
