**[Vimm's Lair: Vault](https://vimm.net/vault/) (DDL / Torrent)**

Vimm provides Torrents for larger Downloads like Wii Games, since the site's Download speed is a bit slow.

**[PortalRoms Archive](https://1fichier.com/?pptel9kppt5ay95nxfmw) (Torrent)**

Before PortalRoms shut down, one of Ripped's Staff Members made a Backup of all its ROM Downloads.
*If you Download one of these Torrents **please** seed them as long as possible.*

**[Ziperto](https://www.ziperto.com) (DDL)**

Nice source for Nintendo and PlayStation ROMs, unfortunately only has those.

**[CiasPara3DS](https://ciaspara3ds.blogspot.com/) (DDL)**

This site is a pretty nice source for 3DS CIA Games, if you're a bit rusty in Spanish you might need to use a Translate Extension.

You can easily Download 3DS Games by scanning a QR code with the [FBI](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-fbi-open-source-cia-installer.386433/) app.

<sub>Installing via QR code on the 3DS may be quite slow as the device does not have a great network chip.</sub>
