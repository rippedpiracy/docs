 The best places to get VITA, PS3, PSP, PSX Games / DLCs and more, directly from Sony's servers with no Middle-Man.

**[Vimm's Lair: Vault](https://vimm.net/vault/) (DDL / Torrent)**

Vimm provides Torrents for larger Downloads like Wii Games, since the site's Download speed is a bit slow.

Mr. AlvRo has organized all of his ROM's Download links via 1fichier in a Google Spreadsheet, for ease of browsing.

**[PortalRoms Archive](https://1fichier.com/?pptel9kppt5ay95nxfmw) (Torrent)**

Before PortalRoms shut down, one of Ripped's Staff Members made a Backup of all its ROM Downloads.
*If you Download one of these Torrents **please** seed them as long as possible.*

**[Ziperto](https://www.ziperto.com) (DDL)**

Nice source for Nintendo and PlayStation ROMs, unfortunately only has those.

**[CiasPara3DS](https://ciaspara3ds.blogspot.com/) (DDL)**

This site is a pretty nice source for 3DS CIA Games, if you're a bit rusty in Spanish you might need to use a Translate Extension.

**[hShop](https://hshop.erista.me/) (DDL)**

You can easily Download 3DS Games by scanning a QR code with the [FBI](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-fbi-open-source-cia-installer.386433/) app.

<sub>Note: Installing via QR code on the 3DS may be quite slow as the device does not have a great network chip.</sub>


**[nsw2u](https://nsw2u.xyz/) (DDL)**

Changes domains frequently, offering NSP / XCI files for Switch Games, with Updates included.

**[CDRomance](https://cdromance.com/) (DDL)**

Site comparable to [Ziperto](https://ziperto.com) which offers more ROMs, for different consoles, uploaded directly to the site.
