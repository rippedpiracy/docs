A very popular Torrenting site which has an incredible amount of content, but also has major downsides including insufficient moderation in general (not banning uploaders who have uploaded Malware in the past) and an *incredibly* unsafe Software category.  
**<span style="color:red"><u>Only get Games from [FitGirl](https://1337x.to/user/FitGirl/), [DODI](https://1337x.to/user/DODI/), [KaOsKrew](https://1337x.to/user/KaOsKrew/), [0xEMPRESS](https://1337x.to/user/0xEMPRESS/), and [johncena141](https://1337x.to/user/johncena141/).</u></span>  
Remember to <u>NEVER</u> get Software Releases from this site.**

**[RARBG](https://rarbg.to) (Torrent)**

A very safe site to get Games from, mostly Scene Releases which they have Auto Uploading Bots for. If you use a VPN get ready to solve reCAPTCHAs.  

**[RuTor](http://rutor.info) (Torrent)**

An old Russian tracker that has plenty of content but with generally less seeders. Some Repackers upload exclusively here.  
**Only get Games from R.G. Mechanics, Chovka, XATAB and FitGirl**.

## Repackers

**[FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

One of the most well known and reputable Repacker out there, very active and provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Only downside being the Repacks can take a long time to install depending on your hardware. Mostly Uploads on 1337x, RuTor, Tapocheck and some DDL mirrors that are linked on her site.

**[DODI](https://dodi-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

Another active Repacker that provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Usually takes less time to install compared to FitGirl, while having ever so slightly larger Releases. Other than DDL Mirrors on his site, he Uploads on 1337x.

**[ScOOt3r](https://scooter-repacks.site/) (Torrent / DDL)**

A new and emerging group of Repackers, have Torrent links on some of their releases albeit very low seeders. Updates on their Releases may be quicker than other Repackers.  
*<small>Replace any instance of <https://scoot3r191.github.io/gcrypt/> with <https://drive.scooter-repacks.site/> when trying to visit the decryption link and when using the encrytped link.</small>*

**[KaOsKrew](https://kaoskrew.org/viewforum.php?f=13) (Torrent / DDL)**

Old and still ongoing Repackers, recently merged with Masquerade. Their Torrents may have lower seeders compared to other Repackers. They upload on 1337x too.

## Cracking Tools

**All the tools listed here are** <span style="color:red">**Windows**</span> **only unless stated otherwise.**  
<small>All DLC unlocker tools require the actual DLC files to work, to find the DLC files: find the Game topic in [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) and check the first post for links to the DLC files. If there are none, then use the searchbar to search for the DLC files within the thread or just pirate the entire Game and extract the DLCs.</small>
