## General Torrent

**[1337x.to](https://1337x.to)** | **[.st](https://1337x.st/)** | **[.gd](https://1337x.gd/)** | **[.eu](https://x1337x.eu/) (Torrent)**

A very popular Torrenting site which has an incredible amount of content, but also has major downsides including insufficient moderation in general (not banning uploaders who have uploaded Malware in the past) and an *incredibly* unsafe Software category.  
**<span style="color:red"><u>Only get Games from [FitGirl](https://1337x.to/user/FitGirl/), [DODI](https://1337x.to/user/DODI/), [KaOsKrew](https://1337x.to/user/KaOsKrew/), [0xEMPRESS](https://1337x.to/user/0xEMPRESS/), and [johncena141](https://1337x.to/user/johncena141/) (who uploads Linux Games).</u></span>

**Only get Games from [Chovka](http://rutor.info/browse/0/0/1642915/0) and [FitGirl](http://rutor.info/browse/0/0/1224038/0)**.

## Repackers

**[FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

**[DODI](https://dodi-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

Another active Repacker that provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Usually takes less time to install compared to FitGirl, while having ever so slightly larger Releases. Other than DDL Mirrors on his site, he Uploads on 1337x.

**[CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) (DDL)**

*<small>Most Games that are uploaded to this site are uncracked and require a <a target="_self" href="#cracking-tools">Steam Emulator</a> to function, especially when it's mentioned that the upload is "Clean (Steam) Files" or when it's uploaded to the [Steam Content Sharing](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=22) (SCS) forum.</small>*

## Cracking Tools

**All the tools listed here are** <span style="color:red">**Windows**</span> **only unless stated otherwise.**  
**Most links here require sign-up on [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum).**  
<small>All DLC unlocker tools require the actual DLC files to work, to find the DLC files: find the Game topic on [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) and check the first post for links to the DLC files. If there are none, then use the searchbar to search for the DLC files within the thread or just pirate the entire Game and extract the DLCs. Note that rarely, DLC files will come preinstalled with the base Game.</small>

[**Koalageddon**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=112021) - An incredibly easy to use DLC unlocker for Steam, Epic Games, Origin, EA Desktop & Uplay (R1 only) for legitimately owned Games. Family Sharing restrictions can also be bypassed. It can also work with Games that have Anti-Cheat such as EAC and VAC, though it is inadvisable to do so (even though there have been no confirmed cases of bans).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[KG-GUI](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=112374) - A simple GUI to configure Koalageddon.

[**SmokeAPI**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=122487) | [**CreamAPI**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=70576) & [**StellarKey**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=120717) - Tools that can unlock all DLCs on legitimately owned Steam Games, may not work well if the Game has Anti-Cheat. SmokeAPI requires no configuration and therefore is very beginner friendly. StellarKey is for <span style="color:red">**Linux**</span> only.  
*<small>CreamAPI [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWenVCEfxhs5gvOUj5G_fefO_B6t-B33M6nbuYJsSTg). StellarKey may not work well with non-native Linux Games played through Proton.</small>*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Uplay R1 Unlocker](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=112169) - Same as R2 Unlocker, but instead will only work for Games released before October 2020 (that have the uplay_r1\*.dll file).

Goldberg supports <span style="color:red">**Linux**</span>, it is easy to use and actively maintained with lots of features but lacks some features SSE has, such as: Bypassing SteamStub DRM, a pre-packaged Game Launcher and support for Plugins but development has stopped since April 11, 2017.  
**SmartSteamEmu is abandoned. If you're having issues with it, try the [SSE Reborn Client v1.46.1](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2009102#p2009102).**  
There is a <span style="color:red">**Mac**</span> [build](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/uploads/cde2e83836714923757cad6be93c5186/macosx64.zip) for Goldberg but it's outdated and only supports Mac x64.

ACTIVATED on the other hand is a Steam Emulator for <span style="color:red">**Mac**</span>.  
*<small>You can also use this small handful [guide](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1842767#p1842767) on setting up ALI213. You can generate Steam Interfaces for ACTIVATED using [this tool](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/blob/master/Readme_generate_interfaces.txt) from the Goldberg Emu, but all in all ACTIVATED is not recommended due to its difficulty to set up.</small>*

## Redistributables

<small>Most of the time you can tell which redistributables are required for a specific Steam Game by going on its page at <https://steamdb.info/> and clicking the "Depots" section on the sidebar. On the "EXTRE INFO" column, if it mentions "Depot from 228980" then you can be sure those files are required.  
Some common redistributables are:</small>
