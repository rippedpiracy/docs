*<small>We do not recommend using [µTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com) or [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), as it came bundled with Adware, Spyware, and Crypto-Miners in the past [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). In its current state, it's Adware and Bloatware. We don't recommend using µTorrent v2.2.1 either due to confirmed Security Exploits.</small>*
