## ROMs

**[ROMSPURE](https://romspure.cc/roms) (DDL)**

Contains large collection of ROMs from every type of system.

**[RomUlation](https://www.romulation.org/) (DDL)**  

Offering ROM Downloads since 2004.

**[Vimm's Lair: Vault](https://vimm.net/vault/) (DDL / Torrent)**

Vimm provides Torrents for larger Downloads like Wii Games, since the site's Download speed is a bit slow.

## Emulators

[/emugen/ Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) - The **ULTIMATE** guide for all Emulators on all Platforms.  
*<small>Make sure to check with your Emulator [here](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files) in case it requires some sort of BIOS or special file to function.</small>*

<small>**Stable PS4/PS5 or Xbox One/Xbox Series Emulators do not exist. If you find an app that claims to be that, it's a scam or it's highly unstable.  
Some examples for scam apps are: PCSX4, PCSX5, PSemuX, RPCS4.**</small>

## Apps

[**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org) | [**Deluge**](https://www.deluge-torrent.org) | [**Transmission**](https://transmissionbt.com/) - Free, Lightweight and open source Torrent Clients.  
*<small>We do not recommend using [µTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com) or [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), as it came bundled with Adware, Spyware, and Crypto-Miners in the past [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). In its current state, it's Adware and Bloatware. We don't recommend using µTorrent v2.2.1 either due to confirmed Security Exploits.</small>*
