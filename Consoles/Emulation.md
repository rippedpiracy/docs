**Use an AdBlocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [FastForward](https://fastforward.team) while browsing these sites!**  
**Downloaded ROM files that have Application file extension .exe are likely Malware!**  
**<small>Note: Many of the tools on the <a target="_self" href="/Utilities/Misc">Misc</a> page can be used to improve your downloading experience.</small>**

## ROMs

**[Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/) (DDL)**

Website focused on Game preservation with lots of different systems to choose from.

**[r/ROMs Megathread](https://r-roms.github.io/) (DDL)**

The r/ROMs Megathread, with links for Popular and Arcade ROMs, visualized with mkdocs.

**[NoPayStation](https://nopaystation.com/) (DDL)**

 The best place to get VITA, PS3, PSP, PSX Games / DLCs and more, directly from Sony's servers with no Middle-Man.

**[ROMSPURE](https://romspure.cc/roms) (DDL)**

Contains large collection of ROMs from every type of system.

**[RomUlation](https://www.romulation.org/) (DDL)**  

Offering ROM Downloads since 2004.  
*<small><b>Ignore any Pop-ups/Banners about faster Downloads/Premium. Try another ROM site if the Download is for Premium Users.</b></small>*

**[Vimm's Lair: Vault](https://vimm.net/vault/) (DDL / Torrent)**

Vimm provides Torrents for larger Downloads like Wii Games, since the site's Download speed is a bit slow.

**[AlvRo's Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tAZ1KNEUZ58e-4kPJGh947alDb1oyrNpzcnCLk7DEE/pubhtml) (DDL)**

**[Ziperto](https://www.ziperto.com) (DDL)**

Nice source for Nintendo and PlayStation ROMs, unfortunately only has those.

**[hShop](https://hshop.erista.me/) (DDL)**

You can easily Download 3DS Games by scanning a QR code with the [FBI](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-fbi-open-source-cia-installer.386433/) app.  
*<small>Installing via QR code on the 3DS may be quite slow as the device does not have a good NIC chip.</small>*

**[CDRomance](https://cdromance.org/) (DDL)**

A Site similar to [Ziperto](https://ziperto.com) which offers more ROMs for different consoles, uploaded directly to the site.

## Emulators

[/emugen/ Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) - The **ULTIMATE** guide for all Emulators on all Platforms.  
*<small>Make sure to check with your Emulator [here](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files) in case it requires some sort of BIOS or special file to function.</small>*

<small>**Stable Switch 2, PS4/PS5 or Xbox One/Xbox Series Emulators do not exist. If you find an app that claims to be that, it's a scam or it's highly unstable.  
Some examples for scam apps are: PCSX4, PCSX5, PSemuX, RPCS4.**</small>

## Apps

[**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org) | [**Deluge**](https://www.deluge-torrent.org) | [**Transmission**](https://transmissionbt.com/) - Free, Lightweight and open source Torrent Clients.  
*<small>We do not recommend using **µTorrent** or **BitTorrent**, as it came bundled with Adware, Spyware, and Crypto-Miners in the past [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). In its current state, it's Adware and Bloatware. We don't recommend using µTorrent v2.2.1 either due to confirmed Security Exploits.</small>*
