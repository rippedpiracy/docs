Remember to always use an ad-blocker like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).  

> It is generally advised to avoid aggregator websites as they consist very annoying ads, compress images drastically and neither update best quality releases. PS: Avoid batoto, they were recently running malicious scripts and pop-ups for monetary purposes.  
> Scans and officials' reading should suffice with the top two choices, in case of a very niche series or series licensed only for paperback publishing, do check [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si) - torrent tracker.

## Web reading

* [**MangaDex**](https://mangadex.org/) - Top choice for manga reading. The main site where all scanlators upload primarilily. No image compression, no ads, ability to choose from different releases and recieve edits from uploaders directly.   
* [**Mangasee123**](https://mangasee123.com/) - Our second best choice. Aggregator site with no image compression but has ads (Use Ublock). Consists of massive library of scans + offcials.
