## Transparency

The Ripped Guide stores **0 Cookies** in your Browser, doesn't use **IndexedDB** and only uses a <kbd>dark</kbd> or <kbd>light</kbd> value in **Local Storage** for the Theme.  

The Ripped Guide uses [**self-hosted Plausible Analytics**](https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics) to measure site activity.  
<small>This does __not__ log any personal information apart from Country of the request, Resolution, User-Agent and Referrer.</small>
